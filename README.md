Statistical Report on Horror Movies Profitability
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the profitability of horror movies within the Hollywood film industry. The focus of the analysis is to examine the financial performance of horror films, specifically looking at their return on investment (ROI), and comparing their profitability to other major genres, such as action/adventure and summer blockbusters.

Project Overview
The dataset used for this analysis includes both qualitative and quantitative variables, such as:

Movie Title
Production Company
Domestic Gross
Worldwide Gross
Distributor
MPAA Rating
Genre
The analysis aims to provide insights into why horror films, despite contributing only a small share of the overall box office, are highly profitable in terms of ROI. By focusing on cases like Paranormal Activity, which was made for $450,000 and earned $194 million, this report highlights the extreme profitability that can be achieved in the horror genre.

Key Findings
Horror movies, on average, provide a significantly higher return on investment compared to other genres.
High-budget blockbusters often underperform in terms of ROI, making horror films a more attractive financial opportunity for studios looking for cost-effective production strategies.
Notable examples, such as Paranormal Activity, showcase how low-budget films can exceed expectations and generate massive returns.
